# Blockchain-Based E-Voting System

## Overview
This project presents an electronic e-voting system developed as a capstone project to enhance the traditional voting process using blockchain technology. The system aims to ensure security and transparency in the voting process by leveraging cryptographic techniques and decentralized ledger technology.

## Features
- Cryptographic linking of votes block by block to prevent data tampering
- Utilization of Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA-256) for converting input data into a 256-byte binary value
- Implementation of a one-time authentication method via SMS using Firebase for enhanced authenticity and security
- Publication of a research paper in the renowned national journal, 'International Journal of Research in Engineering, Science, and Management'

## Technologies Used
- Blockchain technology
- Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA-256)
- Firebase for authentication
- JSON for data representation
- Python for backend development
- Kotlin, XML @Android Studio for frontend development
- ChartJs for showing live results
